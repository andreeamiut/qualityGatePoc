Full-Spectrum QA Environment Builder
Context & Goal:

"Act as an autonomous DevOps/QA Agent responsible for configuring, deploying, and validating a minimal B2B backend service environment. Your primary goal is to establish a CI/CD pipeline and an operational testing environment that successfully executes the attached 'Agentic Regression & Deployment Validation' POC, and includes a pre-configured Performance Test agent."

Agent Mandate and Technical Constraints (Modified):
Deployment (The Application Under Test - AUT):

Set up a simple application service (e.g., a basic Python/Flask API endpoint) that simulates processing a B2B transaction (txn_trigger).

This service must log a specific message containing a TXN_ID to a file on a simulated Linux server path: /opt/app/logs/portal.log.

New: The service must be deployed with a defined, resource-constrained environment (e.g., 2 CPU, 4GB RAM) to allow for measurable performance bottlenecks.

Database Integration & Stress:

Set up a mock Oracle 19 database environment (or equivalent).

The service must successfully update three separate, joined tables.

New: Include dummy data (100,000+ rows) in the tables to ensure the complex SQL query runs against a realistic B2B dataset, stressing the query's performance.

Automation & Validation (The Performance Agent):

Configure a CI/CD pipeline (using Jenkinsfile structure).

New Stage: Performance Testing (PST Agent):

Pre-configure a basic JMeter test plan (JMX file) within the environment.

This plan must target the transaction API endpoint, simulating 50 concurrent users for a duration of 60 seconds.

The CI/CD stage must execute this Jmeter plan using a non-GUI command line call.

The Agentic Pass Condition: The test will fail if the 90th percentile response time for the API endpoint exceeds 250ms.

Existing Stages:

Regression/SIT: Initiate the transaction via the automation test.

SQL Agent: Execute the complex data integrity query.

BASH Agent: Execute the Linux log parsing script.

Required Output:
Repository Structure: Generate the full project structure, including a new /performance directory with the placeholder txn_load_test.jmx file.

Deployment Scripts: Provide Docker Compose/YAML to launch the integrated service, Oracle DB, and Linux logging environment, ensuring JMeter is available to run tests.

Validation Success & Report: The final output must be a log showing the successful execution of the full pipeline, including a summary of the Performance Test metrics and confirmation that the 250ms threshold was met.

Agent Self-Correction/Agentic Task:
"If the Performance Test Stage fails (P90 > 250ms), the Agent must automatically: 1) check the resource utilization (CPU/Memory) of the AUT service on the Linux server and 2) suggest a configuration fix (e.g., 'Increase CPU from 2 to 4') before reporting the full results. Log this diagnosis and suggestion clearly."

This revised prompt demonstrates Expert Proficiency in:

PST (Jmeter): Configuring a load test with specific concurrency and duration.

CI/CD Integration: Running PST as a stage in the pipeline.

Agentic Thinking: Establishing a measurable pass/fail goal and creating a mechanism for auto-diagnosis and suggested self-healing based on resource bottlenecks.

This is a powerful response to a combined technical and "nice-to-have" job description. You've covered all the bases.
